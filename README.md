## Music Sharer: A Demo for decentralized music communication application using GunDB

---

#### Background
This project serves as a simple implementation of a decentralized application (dApp) using GunDB to demonstrate the capacity of decentralized/distributed data system. 

#### Usage
No need for any backend setup; all you need to do is to visit https://yunokiisshin.github.io/music-sharer/ to share bits and pieces of audio files. Since this is an introductory implementation, it doesn't support large files; I can work around by integrating IndexedDB into the program. 

##### User system
When you initially sign up, choose a username and passphrase. Then, click sign up. After that, you can log in any time with those credentials.

##### Uploading
Simply follow the in-screen instructions to upload files. They will be displayed below the upload button. You can also delete your uploaded contents.

##### Seeing others' uploads
Have other users send you a public key, and enter it in the public key search section. Then, you can view (not edit) their list of music!

It is a very simplistic implementation; yet, I think it shows a great potential for future work.
