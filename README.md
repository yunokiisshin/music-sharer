## Music Sharer: A Demo for decentralized music communication application using GunDB

---

#### Background
This project serves as a simple implementation of a decentralized application (dApp) using GunDB to demonstrate the capacity of decentralized/distributed data system. 

#### Usage
No need for any backend setup; all you need to do is to visit https://yunokiisshin.github.io/music-sharer/ to share bits and pieces of audio files. Since this is an introductory implementation, it doesn't support large files; I can work around by integrating IndexedDB into the program.
